-- | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned
-- in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort
-- results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using
-- orderBy=\"creationTimestamp desc\". This sorts results based on the
-- creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
-- first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
-- operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by name or
-- creationTimestamp desc is supported.

-- | The name of the zone for this request.
il1Zone :: Lens' InstancesList Text
il1Zone = lens _il1Zone (\ s a -> s{_il1Zone = a})

-- | Sets a filter {expression} for filtering listed resources. Your
-- {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string
-- literal_string. The field_name is the name of the field you want to
-- compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number,
-- boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not
-- equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The
-- literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by
-- (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is
-- interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value
-- must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that
-- do not have a name of example-instance, you would use name ne
-- example-instance. You can filter on nested fields. For example, you
-- could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart
-- field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of
-- labels to organize and search for results based on label values. To
-- filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
-- parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq
-- us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions,
-- meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

-- | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the
-- number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine
-- returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results
-- in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive.
