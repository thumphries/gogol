-- | The deletionType query string enables the cancellation, downgrade, or
-- suspension of a subscription.
data SubscriptionsDeleteDeletionType
    = Cancel
      -- ^ @cancel@
      -- Cancels the subscription immediately. This does not apply to a G Suite
      -- subscription.
    | Downgrade
      -- ^ @downgrade@
      -- Downgrades a G Suite subscription to a Google Apps Free edition
      -- subscription only if the customer was initially subscribed to a Google
      -- Apps Free edition (also known as the Standard edition). Once downgraded,
      -- the customer no longer has access to the previous G Suite subscription
      -- and is no longer managed by the reseller. A G Suite subscription\'s
      -- downgrade cannot be invoked if an active or suspended Google Drive or
      -- Google Vault subscription is present. The Google Drive or Google Vault
      -- subscription must be cancelled before the G Suite subscription\'s
      -- downgrade is invoked. The downgrade deletionType does not apply to other
      -- products or G Suite SKUs.
    | Suspend
      -- ^ @suspend@
      -- (DEPRECATED) The G Suite account is suspended for four days and then
      -- cancelled. Once suspended, an administrator has access to the suspended
      -- account, but the account users can not access their services. A
      -- suspension can be lifted, using the reseller tools. A G Suite
      -- subscription\'s suspension can not be invoked if an active or suspended
      -- Google Drive or Google Vault subscription is present. The Google Drive
      -- or Google Vault subscription must be cancelled before the G Suite
      -- subscription\'s suspension is invoked.
    | TransferToDirect
      -- ^ @transfer_to_direct@
      -- Transfers a subscription directly to Google.  The customer is
      -- immediately transferred to a direct billing relationship with Google and
      -- is given a short amount of time with no service interruption. The
      -- customer can then choose to set up billing directly with Google by using
      -- a credit card, or they can transfer to another reseller.
